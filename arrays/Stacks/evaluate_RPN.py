# #You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
# Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.
# Note that:
#The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
#Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
#The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
#There will not be any division by zero.
#The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
#The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
